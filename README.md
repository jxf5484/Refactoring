### Refactoring

## About 

We set up an HTML file for the First Trainer. We also learn the Css by styling it and updating the website. 

HTML Changes: The title was changed to Horiseon Header element. I also have modified the footer as well. I have remove unnecessary coding in the html. 

CSS Changes: I have change the Font of the title header thoughout the html. Some were changed from H2 to H3, I had to make sure that it is increased 1 layer down or up.
